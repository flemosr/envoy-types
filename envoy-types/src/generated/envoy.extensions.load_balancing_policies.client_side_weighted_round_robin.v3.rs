/// Configuration for the client_side_weighted_round_robin LB policy.
///
/// This policy differs from the built-in ROUND_ROBIN policy in terms of
/// how the endpoint weights are determined. In the ROUND_ROBIN policy,
/// the endpoint weights are sent by the control plane via EDS. However,
/// in this policy, the endpoint weights are instead determined via qps (queries
/// per second), eps (errors per second), and utilization metrics sent by the
/// endpoint using the Open Request Cost Aggregation (ORCA) protocol. Utilization
/// is determined by using the ORCA application_utilization field, if set, or
/// else falling back to the cpu_utilization field. All queries count toward qps,
/// regardless of result. Only failed queries count toward eps. A config
/// parameter error_utilization_penalty controls the penalty to adjust endpoint
/// weights using eps and qps. The weight of a given endpoint is computed as:
/// `qps / (utilization + eps/qps * error_utilization_penalty)`.
///
/// See the :ref:`load balancing architecture  overview<arch_overview_load_balancing_types>` for more information.
