/// HTTP/1.1 proxy transport socket establishes an upstream connection to a proxy address
/// instead of the target host's address. This behavior is triggered when the transport
/// socket is configured and proxy information is provided.

/// # Behavior when proxying:
///
/// When an upstream connection is established, instead of connecting directly to the endpoint
/// address, the client will connect to the specified proxy address, send an HTTP/1.1 `CONNECT` request
/// indicating the endpoint address, and process the response. If the response has HTTP status 200,
/// the connection will be passed down to the underlying transport socket.
///
/// # Configuring proxy information:
///
/// Set `typed_filter_metadata` in :ref:`LbEndpoint.Metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.lbendpoint.metadata>` or :ref:`LocalityLbEndpoints.Metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.LocalityLbEndpoints.metadata>`.
/// using the key `envoy.http11_proxy_transport_socket.proxy_address` and the
/// proxy address in `config::core::v3::Address` format.
