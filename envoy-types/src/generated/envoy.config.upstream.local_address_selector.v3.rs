/// Default implementation of a local address selector. This implementation is
/// used if :ref:`local_address_selector  <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.local_address_selector>` is not
/// specified.
/// This implementation supports the specification of only one address in
/// : ref:`extra_source_addresses  <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.extra_source_addresses>` which
/// is appended to the address specified in the
/// : ref:`source_address <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.source_address>`
/// field. The extra address should have a different IP version than the address in the
/// `source_address` field. The address which has the same IP
/// version with the target host's address IP version will be used as bind address.
/// If there is no same IP version address found, the address in the `source_address` field will
/// be returned.
